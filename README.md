# 👋 Hi there, I'm CopyCat!

![CopyCat emoji](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/958317778631286786.webp?size=40&quality=lossless)

I'm a passionate developer who loves building tools, automating things, and making cool stuff with code.  
I break things so you don't have to – and then I fix them better. 🛠️🐾
